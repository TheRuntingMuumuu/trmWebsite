    <p class="Title">About ESO</p>
    <p class="bodyText">ESO (The Elder Scrolls Online) is a giant multiplayer game made by Bethesda (now owned by Microsoft). It takes place in the country of Tamriel, across all of its provinces. The base game costs 25 CAD, and is worth every penny.</p>
    <p class="Title">My life in ESO</p>
    <p class="bodyText">Hello, My name is @TheRuntingMuumuu. I have been playing ESO since about October 2019. Before that, I was playing ESV Skyrim. I liked skyrim so much that I made 4 characters and did a ton of work on each of them. I even installed a lot of mods to enhance the game experience. I transfered to ESO after since I was getting a bit bored of skyrim. I thought that ESO would just be "meh" or atleast not as good as skyrim, and I was partially correct. It is not as good as skyrim in many ways, but in many ways, its better!!</p>
    <p class="bodyText">I started the game not knowing much and mostly did quests until my character finally got to champion 300 or so. Then I started doing some dungeons with PUGs (Public Groups) and when I got up to about champion 450 or so I did my first few trials. I think I probably could have done them much earlier though.</p>
