        <p class="Title">Quentavar</p>
          <p class="bodyText">Quentavar is my Sorcerer DPS. He wears mothers sorrow, and law of julianos with the Valkyn Skoria helmet/shoulders. I am working on getting him False Gods and Maw of the Infernal. He currently does 21.7k dps, and he is my main. I am also leveling up his crafting abilities in hopes of getting him to be a master crafter. He is currently level 50 in all the crafts except for Provisioning, Enchanting, and Jewlery. (the image is a bit old, now he has a new mount (whispering claw senche-raht), and does not use a skin (since he has some markarth DLC face markings))</p>
          <p class="bodyText">He wears the Dark Brotherhood Robes with the Markarth Face Markings. He has the Whispering Claw Senche raht as his mount, and he does not have a non-combat pet (since they all get in the way) He also uses the wolf hunter hat from from the werewolf dungeon (I cant remember the name)</p>

        <p class="Title">Roggvir the Mighty</p>
          <p class="bodyText">Roggvir is my tank. He is currently level 50 and I do many dungeons on him since tanks queue very quickly (Obviously I don't queue for vet ones). I am finding out that I actually like tanking, but I don't know if I prefer it over DPS. He will just be my tank, (not main quester or crafter) but I plan to get him doing trials someday.</p>

        <p class="Title">Admiral Rubbish</p>
          <p class="bodyText">Admiral rubbish is a Vampire Nightblade Assassin. He is currently level 50. He is an avid member of the thieves guild, and the dark brotherhood. I use him to gather mats since he is very fast due to his gear, and ability set. (Due to U27, he lost rapid manouver but I recently regained it.) He can also make gold fairly quickly if I were to sell all of the mats that I have gathered.</p>

        <p class="Title">Hits-Head-on-Cabinet</p>
          <p class="bodyText">This is my future stamblade. I want him to use a bow/bow setup. He is an argonian (should be obvious given the name) and he is only level 8 at the moment. I intend to get him to be doing trials in the future though. Sadly I do not have a picture for him yet.</p>

        <p class="Title">Quaranar (Witch Farmer)</p>
          <p class="bodyText">Quaranar is dps Warden (magden). He wears beginner gear with no monster healm (julianos/ms) and he is currently doing about 18.5k dps. For some reason, my sister calls him a "Witch Farmer" though.</a>.</p>

        <p class="Title">Capt. Rubbish</p>
          <p class="bodyText">Capt. Rubbish is my other nightblade. He was kind of a test nightblade and got to level 19 before I changed to Admiral Rubbish... EDIT: I actually never use him anymore and am considering deleting him, but I think that he looks cool so I'll keep the picture on the website.</p>

        <p class="Title">Captain Rubbish</p>
          <p class="bodyText">Captain Rubbish is my very first character. He is a level 11 templar and I only sometimes use him for writs (740G per day...) EDIT: I never use him anymore and are thinking of deleting him. I will only keep the image here since I think he looks very cool (and want to preserve this style for a future templar since I think it looks very cool.)</p>
