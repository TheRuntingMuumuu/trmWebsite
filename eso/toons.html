      <p class="Title">Quentavar</p>
        <p class="bodyText">Quentavar is my Sorcerer DPS. He wears mothers sorrow, and law of julianos with the Valkyn Skoria helmet/shoulders. He currently does 21.7k dps, and he is my main. I am also leveling up his crafting abilities in hopes of getting him to be a master crafter. (The image is extremely out of date)</p>

      <p class="Title">Admiral Rubbish</p>
        <p class="bodyText">Admiral rubbish is a Vampire Nightblade Assassin. He is currently level 50. He is an avid member of the thieves guild, and the dark brotherhood. He is my money making character. He can also gather mats extremely fast due to his gear, and ability set. (Due to U27, he is slower due to the Rapid Maneuver change, but I am working on regaining that skill)</p>

      <p class="Title">Quaranar (Witch Farmer)</p>
        <p class="bodyText">Quaranar is my Healer Warden. At first, he was a DPS, until I found out how bad magden dps were. So now he is my healer. He is not very good, aside from being level 50. He uses 2 inferno staffs (both bars) and fights alongside his bear, and betty netch. For some reason, my sister calls him a "Witch Farmer" though.</a>.</p>

      <p class="Title">Capt. Rubbish</p>
        <p class="bodyText">Capt. Rubbish is my other nightblade. He was kind of a test nightblade and got to level 19 before I changed to Admiral Rubbish...</p>
