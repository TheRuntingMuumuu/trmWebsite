        <p class="Title">Quentavar</p>
          <p class="bodyText">Quentavar is my Sorcerer DPS. He wears mothers sorrow, and false gods with the maw of the infernal helmet/shoulders. He currently does about 65k dps, and he is my main. He has all his crafting skills maxed, and he only needs to unlock a bunch of styles to become a grand master crafter.</p>

        <p class="Title">Roggvir the Mighty</p>
          <p class="bodyText">Roggvir is my tank. He is currently level 50 and I do many dungeons on him since tanks queue very quickly. I am finding out that I actually like tanking, but I don't know if I prefer it over DPS. I tried tanking nMOL and I was pretty bad but I intend to try more in the future.</p>
          <p class="bodyText">He is currently using a dwarven inferno spider, and he rides the whispering claw senche raht. He also wears a costume but I forget which one it is. I just know that you get if for free in the CP levels.</p>

        <p class="Title">Admiral Rubbish</p>
          <p class="bodyText">Admiral rubbish is a Vampire Nightblade Assassin. He is currently level 50. He is an avid member of the thieves guild, and the dark brotherhood. I use him to gather mats since he is very fast due to his gear, and ability set. (Due to U27, he lost rapid manouver but I recently regained it.) He can also make gold fairly quickly if I were to sell all of the mats that I have gathered.</p>
          <p class="bodyText">He wears the Vampire Noble Costume and uses the Wraithshadow steed, with the mudcrab of eternal doom. He is also a stage 4 vampire.</p>

        <p class="Title">Quaranar (Frosty Witch Farmer)</p>
          <p class="bodyText">This is my ice magden and he is a breton. I really like him for solo content and for completing some of the endeavours that are to use x number of class/weopon abilities since he has a good variety of AOEs that can be used a lot in public dungeons. For some reason, my sister calls him a "Frosty Witch Farmer" though.</a>.</p>

        <p class="Title">J'darr Zaada-Ri</p>
          <p class="bodyText">J'darr Zaada-ri is my khajit stamina templar. I mostly made him becuase I want more characters so I can make more gold, but I also find him fun to plan. He is currently level 26.</p>
          <p class="bodyText">He wears Apostle medium legs and shirt, ebonshadow medium the rest, and morag tong swords. All of them are dyed noxophilic black and sigil orange. Picture can be found <a href="pictures/jdarrDye.png">here.</a> He uses the whispering claw senche raht friend his mount... oops I... uhhh... I meant... as his friend since senche rahts are not even 1% mount, they are all friends (this is a joke I have with my brother)</p>

          <p class="bodyText">Nerandil Leranthar is my sorcerer tank in the works. He is not very high level (21) but I am slowly working on him. I want to level him mostly for the writs and the gold that they give.</p>

        <p class="Title">Capt. Rubbish (Now deleted)</p>
          <p class="bodyText">Capt. Rubbish is my other nightblade. He was kind of a test nightblade and got to level 19 before I changed to Admiral Rubbish... He is deleted, but I will keep him here</p>

        <p class="Title">Captain Rubbish</p>
          <p class="bodyText">Captain Rubbish is my very first character. He is a level 11 templar and I only sometimes use him for writs (740G per day...) EDIT: I never use him anymore and are thinking of deleting him. I will only keep the image here since I think he looks very cool (and want to preserve this style for a future templar since I think it looks very cool.)</p>
