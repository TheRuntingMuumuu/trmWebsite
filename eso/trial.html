    <p class="Title">What are trials</p>
    <p class="bodyText">ESO has a lot of content. Some of that content, is trials. Trials are big hard 12 player dungeons. They cannot be done with any less then 12 players. They have 2 modes. Normal and veteran (and veteran hard mode). Normal can be done by anyone who is decent, but veteran ones are much harder (I have not done any.) </p>
    <p class="Title">What ones have I done</p>
    <p class="bodyText">I have done normal Sanctum Ophidia (nSO) in a beginner environment (thanks ATC) It went really well. I did it with <a href="toons.html" class="textLinks">Quentavar</a> (my magsorc) .I intend to do more of them later and will post them here.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">I have completed Maw of Lorkhaj on normal difficulty (nMOL) and I found it really fun. It was again done in an interactive and fun environment (thanks ATC), and I loved doing it.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">I have attempted nHoF (halls of fabrication) but did not finish it. We got stuck on the final boss. We also struggled a lot with the triplets. I do intend to run this one again and hopefully clear it.</p>
