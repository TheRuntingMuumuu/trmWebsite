How to use the program : 
1. Make sure you have python 3 installed on your computer.
2. Run the program with Python.
3. Follow on screen instructions.


Limitations of the program : 
1. It only works on Windows, macOS, and GNU/Linux computers with Python installed. Android and iOS will NOT work easily.
2. When you are entering the dice that you want to reroll, you must enter them in the proper format which is like this : 1 2 3 4 5  OR 1 3 4 NOT 12345 OR 134
3. All inputs must be entered in the exact right format (including spaces: 'chan ce' is not the same as 'chance') or the program may crash.

I included both the OS and the RANDOM modules. The random module is so I can get the dice to roll random numbers. Without it, the dice would not work. The OS module is so that I can make text stand out. It is used for formatting, and making the program look good.

NOTE: The program is very easy to make crash. Make sure to follow on screen instructions and respond to the prompts correctly in the correct format. In the future we may add error handling, but it is not a priority.
