  <div class="text">
    <p>My name is TheRuntingMuumuu. I am a high school student who has a lot of different interests. I am interested in:
      <ul id="">
        <li>Technology (computer hardware, computer software, other)</li>
        <li>Video Games (skyrim, ESO, DOOM 1, Clash Royale)</li>
        <li>School</li>
        <li>Other things.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>I have always enjoyed tinkering with technology for my entire life. Even when I was young, I loved it. I remember my first computer was an old acer aspire one with an intel atom (1C 1.0GHz) and one gb RAM. Its screen was also half smashed. I loved that laptop. I currently have my own custom built desktop computer (FX-6300@3.9GHz, 16gb, GTX1650, 500gb SSD) and it is really slowing down, and very buggy. I also enjoy programming. I currently do not have many <a href="coding/index.html" class="hyperlink">programs</a> but I intend to code some more once this website is done. I have been spending the last 3 or so years busy coding this website so I have not had much time to work on other programs, and programming languages.</p>
    <p>I have also really enjoyed playing video games. I love playing mostly singleplayer games such as Skyrim, DOOM 1, and others, but I also like some multiplayer games such as Elite Dangerous, <a href="/eso/index.html" class="hyperlink">ESO</a>, and Minecraft where I even have my own <a href="minecraft/index.html" class="hyperlink">server</a>. Currently at the time of writing (NOV 11 2020) I only play ESO, and DOOM 1 because they are all that my computer can handle, but I do intend to play more in the future when/if I get a new gaming computer.<p>
    <p>Surprisingly, I also really enjoy school. I try to get good marks in it, and I really enjoy school and learning (not just in school). Currently I am in High School in the online program (because of COVID-19) and I love it. I love both the online school system, and the leaning. I make use of the microsoft office suite to help me learn, and I love it. I would highly suggest that everyone should try the MS office suite even if they are already satisfied with their current suite.</p>
    <p>I am also interested in other things, but they are not as big of a part of my life. (and I cant remember them right now)</p>
    <p>I have this website for many reasons. On the <a href=index.html class="hyperlink">index</a> page I have it divided into all of the sections. The sections are dedicated to many of my interests. Some of them are meant to share information, some of them are meant to show off things I am proud of, some of them are just random, and some of them are to provide easy ways to share stuff. I do intend to grow this site and make it much bigger and I plan to add many more pages, and features such as a planning page once I get the <a href="general/index.html" class="hyperlink">general</a> section up and running.</p>
