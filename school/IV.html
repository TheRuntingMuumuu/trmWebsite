    <p class="Title">Grade 11</p>
    <p class="bodyText">These are some assignments that I am proud of from Grade 11.</p>

    <p class="Title">Computer Engineering (TEJ3M)</p>
      <p class="miniTitle">Metior Game</p>
        <p class="bodyText">This is a metior game that I made in javascript using the P5 JS library. It is really simple code (extremely simple) but I think it is cool!!</p>

        <p class="bodyText"><a class="textLinks mobileNo" href="portal.html?site=jsp5/MetiorGameFinal/index.html">Portal</a></p>

    <p class="Title">Computer Science (ICS4U)</p>
      <p class="miniTitle">Department Store</p>
        <p class="bodyText">This assignment is a program made in java that is a simple POS system for a department store. It is simple, but it is my first time with OOP. It is really good at catching errors and NOT CRASHING :-)</p>
        <p class="bodyText"><b>NOTE: This required a java compiler.</b></p>
        <p class="bodyText"><a class="textLinks" href="Grade11/CS/A2/A2.zip" target="blank" download>Download<a></p>
      <p class="miniTitle">Group Project</p>
        <p class="bodyText">I am not too proud of this project, I am mostly proud of the fact that this was my FIRST GOOD GROUP PROJECT THAT DID NOT COMPLETELY FALL FLAT ON ITS FACE!! I cannot share the code rn since I don't know if everyone else will want me to either share it or remove their names, but I do want it here because I am super proud of this project.</p>
        <p class="bodyText"><b>NOTE: There are no attachments availible.</b></p>

    <p class="Title">Chemistry (SCH3U)</p>
      <p class="miniTitle">Boiling Points and IMF Project</p>
        <p class="bodyText">This is a project that is about Intermolecular and Intramolecular forces and properties (boiling points) of different compounds (mostly covalent). I found the last question to be pretty hard to explain, (the methane anomaly) and I think I did a decent explanation there. So if you are curious about why the boiling point of methane (CH4) is an anomaly compared to other elements in that column (SiH4, GeH4, SnH4), this might be useful to read</p>

      <p class="miniTitle">Reactivity of Metals lab</p>
        <p class="bodyText">This lab explores why the reactivity increases down the periodic table. In this lab, I answered the question of why potassium reacts more violently than lithium and sodium. I think I did a good job explaining this.</p>

      <p class="miniTitle">Flame Test Lab</p>
        <p class="bodyText">This lab explores why some atoms change the colour of a flame when they are put into the flame.</p>

    <p class="Title">Math (MCR3U))</p>
      <p class="miniTitle">Notes</p>
        <p class="bodyText">I had a lot of really good assignments in this course. I had a really good teacher, but he was hard. I think this will probably be my worst mark in math to date, but I feel like I really know what I am doing. I am not going to share any of the assignments from the class (since they were all tests and the teacher may not want me to share it) but I am very proud of this class.</p>
