    <p class="Title">Grade 10</p>
    <p class="bodyText">In grade 10, I went to a virtual school and I loved it. Compared to my old school, it was amazing. I got help when I struggled, and it was just much better.</p>

    <p class="Title">History</p>
      <p class="miniTitle">History Summative</p>
        <p class="bodyText">This assignment was where I had to do a lot of research on a certain aspect of history. I chose military communications technology and I worked very hard on this project despite only getting a 3+. I am proud of it because I found out late that although the teacher had approved my subject, she expected me to research the people throughout the history of military communications which proved to be almost impossible since most of that information was not released to the public. I am proud that I finished the assignment and was able to kind of add people into the assignment however the information is not perfect. Some of the information (about the people) is made up. It is all based on real stories but because of the teacher wanting information that does not exist, I had to make some myself. However all the sources should have the correct info, and the rest I think should be good information.</p>

      <p class="miniTitle">Irony Essay</p>
        <p class="bodyText">For this project I had to write an essay on the effect of irony in a couple of short stories that we read in class. I did well on this essay (grade 9 I did terribly) and I actually understood it. I think it is a fairly good essay (for me at least).</p>
