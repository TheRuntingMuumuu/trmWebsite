      <p class="miniTitle">Glogster assignment</p>
        <p class="bodyText">For this assignment I had to make something that showed stuff about the school. I dont remember much about it other that it went against all of the rules that I had learned in my life about how to make something look cool. But I ended up not doing terribly and I made a very weird thing.</p>

    <p class="Title">English</p>
      <p class="miniTitle">Binder assignment</p>
        <p class="bodyText">For this assignment I had to make a binder cover page for each of the sections. It was the start to my english class, and it was extremely hard. I am happy that this assignment gave my teacher a good first impression of me which was crucial because I ended up really struggling in that course and may have failed had the teacher not helped me a lot.</p>
