  <div class="title box">ADDR4 ROUTERS</div>
  <div class="text">My name is Owen and I am the leader of the ADDR4 Routers clan (Clash Royale, Video Game). This website is here to share the rules and some information about the clan since it is a bit hard to do in Clash Royale. This page will have the rules, and some other information, but more detailed (and better looking) ones can be found on the <a href="https://discord.gg/nKn6vEH9uQ">discord</a>.</div>
  <div class="title box">Rules</div>
  <div class="text">
    <b>The Rules are simple</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Be Nice</li>
      <li>Be Respectful</li>
      <li>Be Appropriate></li>
      <li>Be Active (play AT LEAST once every week)</li>
      <li>Participate in the war (see below)</li>
      <li>Keep the language appropriate</li>
      <li><b>HAVE FUN</b></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="title box">War</div>
  <div class="text">For the war, I want everyone to try to participate every week, but I understand that sometimes things happen and you cannot participate. So, the rule for the clan is that everyone must participate at least ONCE every 2 weeks. It can take as little as 30 seconds to participate if you start a clan battle, and let the enemy win. Also, as incentive for people to participate, if you participate for 5 weeks in a row, you will get the ELDER rank.</div>
