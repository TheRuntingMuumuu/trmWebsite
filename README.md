# trmWebsite
This is the repository for TheRuntingMuumuu's website. You can find it: http://trm.ddns.net. The beta branch can be found at https://theruntingmuumuu.github.io/trmWebsite.

I am trying to now make Github the primary location for my website, (since I got GH working). The old website foles can be found here https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuOY4LneJIRzhfgQzVvFY2imk53QCw

These should be the archives for the website. If the link goes down, please file an issue and i'll try to get the link back up and working ASAP. https://cloud.degoo.com/share/ZnCxiMNVAOcMwR

# Contributing
Put any contributions into the `beta1` branch. `master` is only for commits that are published to the web server, and should only be modified by TheRuntingMuumuu and TheTechRobo, to fix a critical issue with e.g. README.md.
