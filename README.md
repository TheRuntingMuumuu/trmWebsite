# trmWebsite
This is the repository for TheRuntingMuumuu's website. You can find it: http://trm.ddns.net. The beta branch can be found at https://theruntingmuumuu.github.io/trmWebsite.

I am trying to now make Github the primary location for my website, (since I got GH working). The old website foles can be found here https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuOY4LneJIRzhfgQzVvFY2imk53QCw

These should be the archives for the website. If the link goes down, please file an issue and i'll try to get the link back up and working ASAP. https://cloud.degoo.com/share/ZnCxiMNVAOcMwR

# Contributing
Put any contributions into the `beta1` branch. `master` is only for commits that are published to the web server, and should only be modified in rare cases, if there's a critical issue with README.md.

There are better ways to do this, but for now, this is what the contributing guideline is. if you don't follow this rule, we may close your Pull Request and create a new one with the correct base branch. Changes in `master` should only be README.md fixes.

<!--You need to specifically state in your PR that you agree that the license of the site could be changed, and that you will only be consulted about it if you made more than **1** change to the website. This must be done because of legal purposes.-->
